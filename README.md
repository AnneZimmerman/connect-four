## Overview
This repo is for the software implementation of the game of Connect Four. 
This software will allow tow players to play against each other. A description of the game plus the 
requirements of this implementation are provided below.

## The Game
Two players are presented with a 7x6 grid of empty spaces. The players take alternating turns 
marking an empty space with their color: the first player to move is blue and the second is 
green. The first player to fill a winning set of any connected four spaces, either in a row, column, 
or diagonal line, wins. If all spaces are filled and neither player has a winning set, then the game 
results in a tie.
